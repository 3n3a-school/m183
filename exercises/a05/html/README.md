# HTTP Digest Authentication

This is a small demo project in plain html and javascript to illustrate the HTTP digest authentication process.

The goal is to access a private resource located at `https://m183.gibz-informatik.ch/api/httpDigestAuth`. Only these registered users are allowed to access the resource (username : password):
- `britney_s` : `hitMeBaby`
- `bon_jovi` : `badMedicine` 
- `shakira` : `hipsDontLie` 
- `tom_j` : `sexbomb`

The basic authentication process is laied out in the javascript file [scripts/digestAuth.js](scripts/digestAuth.js). It is your task now to complete the implementation.
